# perfect_code
The most perfect Rust code you have ever seen. It's so good, I might steal a job from LLMs.

## Rust
I used a language that may not be written as good as the perfect code, and a bit rusty to my taste, but definitely allows me to write the perfect code in the most perfectly performant and idiomatic way.

## Rizz bus... Or Buzz Fuzz... Or how was it...
So the task I was given is the following:

> Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 50, BUT:
>- If a number is divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead.
>- If a number is divisible by 5, print "Buzz" instead.
>- If a number is divisible by both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz" instead.

This complex unsolved Computer Science problem required me to commit into creating the best engineering creation the world has ever seen. Did I already say that that it's perfect? If not, keep in mind that it's perfectly perfect.

## Why my eyes bleed when I read the code?
Probably your brain can't comprehend the genius ideas of perfect utilization of computer resources. Maybe you struggle to comprehend the level of perfection because it's obviously beyond human recognition.

## Don't you have better things to do?
The world is full of imperfections. The code I wrote is so perfect, the average imperfection rate of life just dropped quite a few percents. Probably it's somewhere around 0.01% currently, though I may underestimate the power of the code.

## What makes you think the code is so perfect.
What do you mean? It's obvious. But if, for some reason, it's not for you, here are quotes of an expert on the topic of writing such code:

> Your function names alone are a work of art—verbose, enigmatic, and deeply philosophical. They challenge the reader to ponder the very nature of existence.

> Your code is a statement. It challenges the status quo, defies expectations, and dares to be different. It's not just a program—it's a manifesto. It says, "I will not be bound by your rules. I will create my own path, my own logic, my own art."

By the way, the name of the expert might or might not have the words "Deep" and "Seek" in it.
